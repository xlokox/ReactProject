   10. PRESENTATION KEY POINTS

================================================================================
                        KEY IMPROVEMENTS
================================================================================

**1. CONCRETE EXAMPLES INSTEAD OF ABSTRACT EXPLANATIONS**
   - Before: "The controller handles authentication"
   - After: "Step 1: Extract email and password from req.body
            Step 2: Validate all fields are provided
            Step 3: Search for customer in MongoDB by email
            ..." (with actual code)

**2. REAL-WORLD SCENARIO WALKTHROUGHS**
   - "When a user clicks 'Login', here's exactly what happens..."
   - "When a user searches for 'laptops under $1000'..."
   - Shows the complete journey from UI to database and back

**3. ACTUAL CODE SNIPPETS WITH DETAILED COMMENTS**
   - Every important function has complete code
   - Line-by-line explanations
   - Input/output examples
   - Error cases shown

**4. VISUAL REPRESENTATIONS USING ASCII DIAGRAMS**
   - Flow diagrams for each process
   - Shows data flow clearly
   - Easy to understand at a glance

**5. TECHNICAL TERMS EXPLAINED IN SIMPLE LANGUAGE**
   - "bcrypt with 10 salt rounds (industry standard for security vs performance)"
   - "HTTP-only cookie (prevents JavaScript access - XSS protection)"
   - "Timing-safe password comparison (prevents timing attacks)"

**6. "WHY I DID THIS" EXPLANATIONS**
   - Every major decision has a "Why I made this decision" section
   - Shows your thought process
   - Demonstrates understanding of trade-offs

================================================================================
                        WHAT YOU CAN NOW EXPLAIN
================================================================================

**1. COMPLETE AUTHENTICATION FLOW**
   - "When a user logs in, first the LoginScreen validates the input,
      then dispatches a Redux action, which calls the API client.
      The request interceptor adds the Authorization header..."
   - You can walk through all 13 steps confidently

**2. HOW INTERCEPTORS WORK**
   - "I created request and response interceptors in the API client.
      The request interceptor automatically adds the JWT token from
      AsyncStorage to every request, so I don't have to manually add
      it in every API call..."

**3. ORDER PLACEMENT PROCESS**
   - "When a user places an order, I first validate all required fields,
      then fetch customer details if not provided, generate a unique
      order number using the format ORD-YYYYMMDD-XXXX, calculate totals,
      create the order in MongoDB, and clear the cart..."

**4. SECURITY MEASURES**
   - "I hash passwords with bcrypt using 10 salt rounds, which is the
      industry standard. I never store full credit card numbers - only
      the last 4 digits. I use HTTP-only cookies to prevent XSS attacks..."

**5. ERROR HANDLING**
   - "I implemented global error handling in the response interceptor.
      When a 401 error occurs, it automatically clears the stored token
      and logs the user out. Network errors show user-friendly messages..."
